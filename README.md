*There are many expressions that result in 42. Do you have what it takes to guess the right one?*

## 🎯 Goal
The goal of this game is to guess a mathematical expression that resolves to a very special number - the answer to life, the universe and everything! That is, the number after which our beloved school was named: **42**!

## 🎮 How to play	
This is meant to be an easy-breezy guessing game. Simply type in a combination of numbers and arithmetic signs, hit enter, and voilà! You'll get to see if you guessed it correctly...

## 📜 Rules
- Type a combination of numbers (**0 to 9**) and signs (**`+`, `-`, `*` and `/`**). This expression must add up to **42**!
- Hit **Enter** to submit your guess.
- Numbers and operators can appear multiple times.
- Your guess must be **6 characters long**! No less, no more.
- If your expression is valid (i.e. evaluates to 42), but is not the correct one, you'll get a clue that will help you have better guesses. This clue can contain the three following characters, each of which meaning the following:
	- **C** - The character you guessed in this spot is part of the correct answer, AND is in the correct spot! Way to go! ✅
	- **T** - The character you guessed in this spot is part of the correct answer, but is in the wrong spot. Try again! ⚠️
	- **X** - This character is not part of the correct answer. Boo! 🍅
- In case your guess does not resolve to 42 or is invalid in any way, you'll get an error message, and will have to tweak it here and there to try again. You can use **Backspace** to erase characters.
- No maximum attempts in this game, so you can keep guessing to infinity and beyond... :rocket:
- Commutative equations (i.e. **1+2+3** and **3+2+1**) are not currently supported, so you'll have to figure that out on your own...
